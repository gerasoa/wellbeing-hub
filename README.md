# Features

## Navbar
The Wellbeing Hub incorporates a responsive navbar that ensures seamless navigation across all sections of the website. This navbar is consistently visible on every page of the project, providing users with easy access to various sections such as the Beginner’s Guide, Support Resources and Helplines, and External Resources.

The navbar is constructed using the [Bootstrap Nav component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/#nav), which ensures that it is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. This provides an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Hero section

The Hero section of the Wellbeing Hub is designed to create a strong visual impact and engage users from the moment they land on the page. This section utilises several key components to achieve its purpose:

Background Image: The background image for the Hero section is sourced from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), a popular platform for high-quality, freely usable images. The chosen image enhances the visual appeal of the section and sets a calming tone for the website.

Typography: To ensure that the text stands out against the background image, a text shadow is applied to the font. This shadow effect improves the contrast and readability of the text, making it easier for users to read the content.

Action Button: The Hero section includes a prominent call-to-action button that directs users to the subscription page. This button is styled using the [Bootstrap Button component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/buttons/) to be visually appealing and encourages users to take action.

The combination of these elements creates an inviting and engaging Hero section that effectively captures the attention of users and guides them towards exploring the Wellbeing Hub further.

## Beginner’s Guide to Mental Health section

The Beginner’s Guide to Mental Health section of the Wellbeing Hub is designed to provide users with introductory information on mental health. This section utilises several key components to achieve its purpose:

Bootstrap Card Component: Each piece of content in this section is presented using the [Bootstrap Card Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/#example). This ensures a consistent and visually appealing layout for all the information. Each card contains a brief description of the video, providing users with an overview of the content before they decide to watch it.

Action Button: Each card includes a [Bootstrap Button](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/buttons/) that directs users to additional resources or videos. This button is styled to be visually appealing and encourages users to explore further.

The combination of these elements ensures that the Beginner’s Guide to Mental Health section is both informative and engaging, providing users with valuable resources in a well-organised format.
